# RasPi-Cam-Record-Stream
This package can be used to split stdin data stream to be written to a file (for storage) and also be output to stdout as well. It's used to get video data input from the Raspberry Pi NOIR camera and redirect the video data to a recorded data file and also STDOUT for online streaming using VLC.
